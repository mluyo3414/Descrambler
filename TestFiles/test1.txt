Is this a question? 
This is a statement. 
This is silly! 
If your program can spell check these correctly; 
you are off to a good start! 

Here are some of the most common words that are spelled 
(or spelt!) differently in American and British English: 

American: color, flavor, honor, neighbor, rumor, labor, humor 
British: colour, flavour, honour, neighbour, rumour, labour, humour 

Other examples: 
American English and British English both retain the noun verb 
distinction in advice advise and device devise (where the pronunciation 
is (ess) for the noun and (zee) for the verb), but American 
English has abandoned the distinction with licence: license and practice: 
practise (where the two words in each pair are homophones) that British 
spelling retains. American English uses license 
and practice for both meanings. 

American English has kept the Anglo-French spelling for defense 
and offense, which are usually defence and offence in British English; 
similarly there are the American pretense and British pretence; but 
derivatives such as defensive, offensive, and pretension are always 
thus spelled in both systems. 

American and Canadian spelling accepts only -ize endings in most cases, 
such as organize, realize, and recognize! 
British usage is split between both (ize) and (ise) (organize: organise, 
realize: realise, recognize: recognise), and the ratio between (ise) and 
(ize) stands at in the British National Corpus. 
In Australia and New Zealand (ise) spellings strongly prevail: the 
(-ise) form is preferred in Australian English at a ratio of about 
according to the Dictionary. 

The distribution of -yse and -yze endings, as in analyse: analyze, is 
different from (-ise) (-ize): (-yse) is British and (-yze) is American. 
Thus, in British English analyse, catalyse, hydrolyse, and paralyse, 
but in American English analyze, catalyze, hydrolyze, and paralyze. 

My favorites, or is it favourites? 
aeroplane airplane 
moustache mustache 
pyjamas pajamas 
speciality specialty 

I guess that you can spell it either "moustache" or "mustache" in 
American English; but not in British English!
